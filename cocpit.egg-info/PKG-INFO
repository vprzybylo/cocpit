## About

A tool for the characterization of cloud particle images from the (<a href="http://www.specinc.com/cloud-particle-imager">CPI</a>) probe.  Accessibility to a future user interface that correlates ice particle imagery with environmental properties will allow users to instantly evaluate the databases classifications without accompanying image storage or computational hardware needs.

Currently, probe images are classified into 9 categories, but further development may extend these classes:

| Category         | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| aggregate         | A combination of several different monomers with a spread out shape in comparison to a compact irregular. Largely irregular.                                                |
| blank             | No target or contrast.  Typically, few pixels.                                                                                                                              |
| blurry/fragment   | Indistinguishable frame due to motion or a particle that largely intersects the image border, is too small to distinguish, or is too pixelated.                             |
| budding rosette   | A rosette shape with short branches.                                                                                                                                        |
| bullet rosette    | A rosette shape with long branches.                                                                                                                                         |
| column            | Rectangular with one axis longer than the other and no signs of aggregation.                                                                                                |
| compact irregular | A small, condensed particle with few to no distinguishable monomers that has an arbitrary shape.                                                                            |
| plate             | Hexagonal and largely independent of aggregation unless the secondary particle is relatively insignificant in size. The surface is smooth and can have transparent regions. |
| rimed             | Evidence of the collection of supercooled water droplets visually apparent as jagged edges                                                                                  |
| sphere            | circular water droplets                                                                                                                                                     |

  * Resources used: NVIDIA DGX-1 server utilizing Tesla V100 GPUs. This system is housed in the University at Albanys Tier-3 Data Center, and managed/maintained by the xCITE (ExTREME Collaboration, Innovation and TEchnology) laboratory. The base DGX-1 V100 system contains 8 Tesla V100 GPUs with a combined total of 40,960 CUDA (graphics) cores, 5120 Tensor cores, and 256GB of GPU memory, all linked by NVIDIAs 300GB/s NVLINK interconnect. The DGX-1 is optimized for data loading, data transformations, and training, which are all critical to the ML processes required by this project.


## Roadmap

* Each image will have time-correlated in situ measurements added to the database via aircraft probes own through dierent cloud layers during field campaign initiatives. The CPI particle timestamp will be used to synchronize with other data systems on board to obtain environmental parameters, that include but are not limited to: location, atmospheric conditions, and other characteristics based on what was measured during the specic field program discussed.
* Provide functions to determine a relative likelihood for a particular thermodynamic property to make up a predefined sample space, such as habit type.
* It cannot be assumed that these particles initiated or grew within the environment at time of capture, hence, there is motivation to use trajectory analysis to track and associate particle characteristics with the environment in which they resided.
